# **DYNAMIC WEB PAGES WITH JAVASCRIPT**

**JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. You can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.**

**JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much more.**

## **_Variables_**

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

-Using var
-Using let
-Using const
-This chapter uses var.

The let and const keywords are explained in the next chapters.

## **_Functions_**

**A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**

**A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).**

function myFunction(p1, p2) {
return p1 \* p2; // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}
