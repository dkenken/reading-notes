          Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada are made
          of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and
          overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and
          flame-broiled as it spins. Ooh, with diced onions and a pinch of
          cilantro. If you were a taco, would you eat yourself? How do you feel
          about hard shelled tacos? Tacos, again? This will be 5 times this week
          and it’s only Tuesday. I’ve been following that taco truck around all
          day. Tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. How bout a gosh darn
          quesadilla? Carne asada on corn tortillas. Say taco one more time.
          Tacos al pastor made with adobada meat. BARBACOA!! These tacos are
          lit. How bout a gosh darn quesadilla? TACOS!! Add in a few el Pastor
          with guac and diced onions. It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra
          is really just a crazed man who’s local taco shop went out of
          business. Let’s do a beef and a chicken, and one with both. Carne
          asada on corn tortillas. CARNITAS!! Um, Tabasco? No thanks, do you
          have any Cholula?<br />
          <br />
          It’s taco Tuesday Monday. I’d have to say, those tacos are on fleek. I
          think I’ve overdosed on tacos. It’s taco Tuesday Monday. It’s a
          wonderful morning for breakfast tacos. Josh’s taco shack is the best
          taco shack. I think I’ve overdosed on tacos. Make it a double there
          pal. Tacos, again? This will be 5 times this week and it’s only
          Tuesday. Side of rice and beans, please. BARBACOA!! Flour or corn

          <h3>Al Pastor</h3>
          <img class="pic" src="/Images/Al Pastor.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Tacos al pastor, the more famous cousin to the taco árabe, loosely
            translates to “shepherd-style” pork. The meat is marinated in a
            blend of chilies and spices, then slow-cooked on trompo using an
            open flame. The spinning mound of pork is usually topped with a
            pineapple, of which thin flecks are often garnished on top of the
            protein for a sweet, tangy kick.

          <h3>Barbacoa</h3>
          <img class="pic" src="/Images/Barbacoa.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Traditionally, Alvarez says barbacoa references the style of cooking
            meat by the Taino people of the Caribbean. In Mexico, it refers to
            slow-cooking over an open flame or in a hole dug into the ground
            until the fatty protein is tender. In northern Mexico and in south
            Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the economic-yet-flavorful beef head or
            beef cheeks (cachete) or goat (cabrito) is often utilized and served
            on weekends, such as at Vera’s Backyard Bar-B-Que in Brownsville.

          <h3>Cabeza</h3>
          <img class="pic" src="/Images/Cabeza.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            The meat from the head of a cow is particularly flavorful, typically
            only requiring salt. Sometimes it’s braised to tenderness, while
            other taquerias may serve it al vapor or steamed. Some spots may
            only utilize the cheeks, such is the case with barbacoa, while
            carnicerias may prepare the head whole.
