#### **_What Is Git?_**

Git is a version control system that allows any user to make changes/stores/reverts to any files. Also, it allows users to collaborate easier/allow changed by multiple users that can be merged together into one source.

##### **Here are some commands I have learned so far:**

**TABLE COMMANDS**

| COMMAND                     | DESCRIPTION                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| git clone                   | Clone a repository to text editor |
| git status                  | Show the modified status          |
| git add                     | To add file content to the index  |
| git commit -m "description" | Changes to take effect            |
| git push origin main        | To push the changes on both sides |

Another way to get help:

git help command

git command --help

man git-command
